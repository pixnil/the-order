This starter allows you to try Strapi with Next.js with the example of a simple e-commerce website where you can buy products.

## Getting started

### Backend

Move to backend folder and run below commands

```
# Using NPM
npm install
npm run build
npm run develop (To start backend server locally)

```

The Strapi server will automatically start and import sample seed data.

### Frontend

Leave the Strapi backend running in the background. Open another terminal tab, and make sure you're in the `frontend` directory:

```bash
cd frontend
```

Then install dependencies and start the server:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install
npm run dev
```

The Next.js server will run here => [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
